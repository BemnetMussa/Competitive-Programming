"""
Question:
- 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].
- quesions must be in-order starting from question 0
- Solving question i will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpoweri questions.

Constraints:
-   1 <= questions.length <= 105
    questions[i].length == 2
    1 <= pointsi, brainpoweri <= 105

Requested: 
- Return the maximum points you can earn from the exam.

Approche:
- questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]     ans = 7
